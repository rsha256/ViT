# ViT
This ViT Project achieves over 80% accuracy on Cifar-10, outperforming LeNet and other well-known CNNs. This is also formatted and serves as a JAX homework assignment for CS 182, as our group's final Project.

## Setup

To set up the environment needed for this project, run
``` 
conda create --name cs182 python=3.10
conda activate cs182
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note you may need to run `conda deactivate` before running `conda activate cs182` if you are already in an environment.
